	When creating Pong, my goals where limited to each step, my goal wasn't the finished product. But it was completed and runs with no errors.
	I faced a couple of challenges on the way to the final product. Making the paddles were one of the first challenges I faced. The dimmenisons were messing me up but stephen helped me out, i gave him credit in the code. The biggest challenge i faced was collison. I spent a good amount of time on it and ended up seeking outside source which only pointed me in the general direction. I used the frame work and had to figure out and implement my code to it.
	As simple as it seems, the boudries and resets upon scoring was probably my biggest triumph. i had no help and no general directing. however after it was completed i noticed on another site to use math to clean it up and not having "random" numbers apearing out of nowhere.
	Only real failure was structs. I understand how to use them and how they work. I was able to implment them into my code, however everytime i used them a paddle would reset itself after moving. i had multiple sets of help and nothing could be figured out.
	If i were to do this again i would build the code around structs and funtions rather than build it and try to work sturcts and funtions into it.
